/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches (since Linux 2.6.16)
              Writing  to  this  file  causes the kernel to drop clean caches,
              dentries and inodes from memory, causing that memory  to  become
              free.

              To  free  pagecache,  use  echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; 
              to free dentries and inodes, use echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches;
              to   free   pagecache,   dentries  and  inodes,  
              use  echo  3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.

              Because this is a non-destructive operation  and  dirty  objects
              are not freeable, the user should run sync(8) first.

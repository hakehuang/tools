#no pass word access

1. generate the private and public key in client. 
ssh-keygen -t dsa
by default the output is 
private_key:id_dsa
prublic_key:id_dsa.pub

you's better rename then to others: like
private_key:id_dsa2
prublic_key:id_dsa2.pub

2. add the public key to server ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, 
cat id_dsa2.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

3. login with private key
for ssh:
ssh -l root -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa2
for scp:
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa2 <local file> root@<server IP>:<path>/<file name>
